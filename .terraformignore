# About .terraformignore -> https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends/remote#excluding-files-from-upload-with-terraformignore
#
# The .terraformignore file can include rules as one would include in a .gitignore file
# - Comments (starting with #) or blank lines are ignored
# - End a pattern with a forward slash / to specify a directory
# - Negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point !
# Note that unlike .gitignore, only the .terraformignore at the root of the configuration directory is considered.
